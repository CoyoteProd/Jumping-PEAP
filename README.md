# Jumping-PEAP

From longtime, I would to connect my Parrot jumping to my Enterprise network and Go everywhere in the building.
"Unfortunately", all my enterprise wifi was WPA2 Enterprise (PEAP + MSVCHAPV2) wich is not available in stock firmware. 

But Now It's Possible:

Requirement : 
 - Jumping Night/Race (EVO) Doesn't work on Sumo because no more RAM
 - My CoyoteProd Libsumo.Net Application (or other application able to change the IPAddress to connect to drone)
 - Windows PC (not mandatory)
 
 Requiert only to if you brick your jumping:
 - Latest Firmware
 - USB Cable 


 Installation :
  - Remove Battery of jumping
  - Connect your Jumping to USB
  - Wait to Green LED
  - Press 4 times on the power button
  - Wait that a new driver come in DeviceManager
  - Install Microsoft Remote RNDIS Driver
